                <p2 class = "p2">A program providing unemployed and underemployed autistic and neurodivergent people with a college education with the opportunity to be part of a simulated work experience. This particular program seems to include links to companies, and their "Neurodiversity Integration Readiness Services" include candidate matching to available jobs. Based in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.</p2></div><br>

            <p2 class = "p2">A job coaching program that helps people with disabilities find work. CES has not historically worked with clients coming from a university background, but I understand they are now starting to take clients with college educations. CES is also called Progressive Employment Concepts. Unlike the Neurodiversity Pathways program, CES is based in Davis.</p2></div>
