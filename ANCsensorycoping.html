                  <li>Headphones – besides wired headphones, there are also Bluetooth headphones
                  that don’t require you to be tethered to your device. If you want to sleep wearing
                  headphones or don’t like the feeling of earbuds in your ears, there are low-profile
                  Bluetooth headbands.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://mynoise.net/">MyNoise.net</a> – Has tons of background noise generators for any mood that
                    you’re in like rain, waterfall, cafe, forest, meditation garden, spaceship…</li>
                    <li>Apps – There are tons of apps for Android, iOS, etc. which can help block out
                    sounds. Search “white noise generator,” “background noise generator,” or
                    “relaxing sounds” (Lisa uses Ambiance Nature Sounds by Mikdroid)</li>
                  </ol>
                </ol>
                  There is an app called <a href="https://www.soundprint.co/">SoundPrint</a> that is used for crowd-sourced measurements of noise levels in
                  restaurants and such like spaces.<br><br>

                <ol type="1">
                  <li>The music building. Contains soft, bouncy chairs. Good as long as one doesn’t mind
                  background music (usually jazz combo rehearsal or someone’s voice lesson) that is
                  sometimes present. Quietest places upstairs in the hallways--you can switch the lights
                  off if you want.</li>

                  <li>The Arboretum. Outdoors, so sound dissipates. Good in appropriate weather and if
                  one doesn’t need electrical outlets.</li>

                  <li>Courtyard behind Everson Hall (probably not a good spot now due to construction,
                  but is extremely quiet otherwise). Outdoors, but there are benches/chairs inside if you
                  want to be indoors. Oak tree in the middle provides shade along with other shorter
                  shrubs.</li>

                  <li>If you like cats, the Physics Building and Veihmeyer Hall are home to several kitties
                  that are pretty friendly if you’re patient. There’s a calico kitty at Veihmeyer Hall that 
                  doesn’t like being petted, though (her bed has a sign saying she’d rather not be 
                  disturbed).</li>

                  <li>If you enjoy nature, North Davis is home to a vast network of trails/greenbelts 
                  (pedestrian/bicycle-only roads--nice because you don’t have to worry about noisy cars),
                  including some that go to a nice pond with lots of wildlife (geese (including baby
                  goslings!), blackbirds, coots, finches/sparrows, wild turkeys, egrets, herons, hawks, 
                  kites, squirrels, dragonflies, ducks, and several barn owls). There’s a cat named Buster                
                  that likes to hang around the pond. These trails and the pond tend to be pretty popular
                  among North Davis residents so you may have to experiment to find a time that won’t 
                  be too overwhelming. From personal experience, it’s usually quietest in the morning
                  before 10 a.m. and in some afternoons.</li>

                  <li>The Health Sciences District. This is in the southwest corner of campus (see map) 
                  and is very quiet because mostly grad students and nursing students hang out here. It 
                  is also very green and beautiful with lots of benches and outdoor tables. The <a href="https://localwiki.org/davis/Health_Sciences_Library">Carlson
                  Health Sciences Library</a> is quieter and less busy than Shields. The Health Sciences
                  District is a bit out of the way, but you can get there via the V or D Unitrans buses from
                  the Silo or walk through Tercero and pass through the tunnel under La Rue.</li>
