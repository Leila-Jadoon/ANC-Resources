Indeed, regional center supports can include housing and many other supports, if you can demonstrate that you need these supports –regional center supports are some of the most potentially extensive disability supports in existence.  Autistic people without intellectual disabilities are sometimes able to obtainregional centersupports under the “fifth category” of service eligibility, but this requires proof of disability-related challenges going back to childhood, whether or not you had a formal autism diagnosis at the time.</p>
